    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hello, everyone! My name is Anthony Benavente. I was born on April 6,
    1995 on the island of Saipan, the capital of the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands">
    Northern Mariana Islands</a> which is a territory of the United States.
    When I was only ten years old, my family and I moved across the pond to
    Raleigh, North Carolina, so that my parents could obtain their masters
    from North Carolina State University.  All my life, I thought I was going
    to follow my parents' footsteps and attend North Carolina State as well to
    become an architect.  However, after taking a semester of art at Green
    Hope High School, Cary, North Carolina, I quickly realized that the dream
    of becoming an architect was impossible. I then adjusted my sights when I
    had recieved my first laptop as a gift from my grandmother (<a
    href="http://reviews.us.samsung.com/7463/NP-RV511-A01US/samsung-rv511-a01-notebook-reviews/reviews.htm">
    this was my first laptop for those curious</a>) and
    decided to dabble in the world of programming and computer science.  Here
    is where I found my niche, my calling, my future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, I am attending Western Carolina University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I
        plan on graduating with my undergraduate degree in 2017 after which I
        will continue on in life, fufilling my dream of working in the industry
        as a computer programmer.  However, one of my future goals in life is
        to obtain my Master's degree, PhD. and become a professor at a
        university.  So thanks for reading about my story, and
        if you'd like to contact me, fill out the form at the bottom of this page.  
        I appreciate your time, and I can't wait to hear from you!

        Thanks,<p></p>Anthony Benavente
